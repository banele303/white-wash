                <p className='text-[17px] leading-7'>
                    Composite decks is a durable alternative to
                    wood decking that is made of recycled plastic
                    and wood fiber. This combination creates a
                    low-maintenance deck solution that is both
                    aesthetically pleasing and resistant to water, pests,
                    bacteria, UV rays, mildew, and even fire. Unlike traditional
                    wood decks, composite decks are available in various colors,
                    shapes, textures and sizes for a customized look.
                    <br />

                    <br />

                    Not only is composite for decking low maintenance,
                    but it also requires fewer occasional repairs than
                    wooden decks. Traditional wooden decks need to be sealed
                    and stained periodically to look their best, whereas composite doesn&apos;t require such treatments.
                    In addition, composite decks won&apos;t splinter or warp due to the composites plastic
                    nature and can handle
                    rough wear and tear better than wood. With a lifespan of up to 25 years, composite decking makes an
                    excellent addition to any outdoor space while eliminating the hassle of maintaining a wood deck over time.
